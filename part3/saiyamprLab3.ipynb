    "## Analysis : We plot the map for the term Flu and notice that there are lot of tweets in Texas 1157 out of the total 10000 tweets, Also Kansas and California have a lot of occurences of these numbers. This clearly shows that these states have still the effect of flu. Normallly the season of flu is from December - February but may still go on till May. These states have an effect of the flu outbreak; Also when we plot these maps using different terms like Flu, influenza, Fever we get similar results as these states are the most focused states where these tweets are coming from. States like North Dakota and Maine have very few occuerences of tweets"
